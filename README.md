# KOPE - Digital Loyalty Card APPðŸ“±

Kope is a app developed for me using React Native for my graduation project at FATEC.

This app aims to facilitate customer loyalty in commercial places. 
The solution includes the registration of establishments, where it registers its rewards available for redemption and the customer's points at each visit. 
Customers, on the other hand, can register on the app, 
view establishments that have loyalty and redeem rewards when they reach the amount of eligible redemption points.
